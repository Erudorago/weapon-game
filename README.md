# Xtreme Weapon Grindfest

## what
A game I'm making by myself. Autoadvancing dungeon crawler with lots of leveling opportunities.
Item and skill leveling inspired by Disgaea. Player is rewarded for making decisions quickly 
through the use of timers in battle. 

### leveling opportunities
type | level range
-----|------------
character | 1 - 100
weapon | 1 - 50
armor | 1 - 50
skill | 1 - 50
item use | 1 - 20

### battle speed rewards
Each decision has a base of 1 second. Decide within `x` seconds to:

x (sec) | effect
--------|-------
.25 (best)    | + 10% crit chance, + 25% exp if enemy dies
.5 (great)    | + 5% crit chance, + 10% exp if enemy dies

Decisions can have subdecisions that reset the timer. Examples: 
- battle menu -> item menu -> item and target selected
- battle menu -> skill menu -> skill and target selected

## motivation
Creator of Stardew Valley, ConcernedApe. Think of what he did; he put in hard work for 4 or 5 
years of his life, and now he has created an incredibly well done game which a lot of people love. He's his
own boss, creates his own schedule, works wherever and however he wants to, and with whoever he
wants to. 

That is too cool.

## how
### Gosu with Ruby
Right now I'm modeling this using Gosu and Ruby. I think I want to continue exploring this in 
Ruby as I feel like it will afford me better automated testing opportunities of the core game
mechanics. The overall logic and battle implementation can be explored without painting to the 
screen, and by doing this I can test how long leveling takes in different encounter scenarios
and with different preset levels for any level-able feature.

### Yoyo Games Gamemaker: Studio
Looking foward, for easy sprite and animation
support, I am going to try using Gamemaker Studio by Yoyo Games. `v1.4` is free for Windows-only
exporting, $150 to also export to OSX and Linux. `v2.0` (still beta?) is $99 for Windows, OSX, 
and Linux exporting. The updated UI looks nice, and there is a free trial version that limits
your resource count and only allows exporting to Windows.
