## Stats

Each instance of a job (charcter) has preset base stats based on the job. These stats can be 
increased by training maps. Should base stat training be expensive? Maybe the maps can only 
be purchased at later levels or something.

Base stats don't change as level goes up, but the `base_stat_multiplier` of the character does.
Maybe for enemies this is the thing that determines XP payout by level?

## Skills

* Strike
